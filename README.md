# i-Relax
A Software to help relax the eyes

#Project Idea :

	The project’s main idea is to relax the eyes and to deviate from the monitor/computer. The eye tribe device will be fit in the laptop to detect the movement of the eyes during the exercise. For the eye exercise, we are looking at the URL http://www.improveeyesighthq.com/how-to-relieve-eye-strain.html. Based on the additional needs, we might add the kinect feature to track the hand movement (ex: Close the eyes with to provide warmth).

# System Architecture :

# Hardware :
Eye Tribe Tracker
Laptop/PC
Kinect/Leap - (in case of additional feature)
Software :
Unity - to detect kinect movements
Tracker SW and Tracker UI
Languages :
C#/Java - to program eye tribe

# Motivation :
	The major users will be the software developers who work continuously in front of the laptop for long time. The strain caused in the eye leads to various problems. Hence, we suggest a recommended break to look at the screen for more than 30 minutes.

# Focus :
	We believe in the quote “A relaxed attitude lengthens life”. So we are trying to keep the body parts relaxed which freshens up mind.

# Team Members :

Nirmal Kumar Ravichandran- C#, Python and Java Software Developer
Dhinesh Kumar Sivakumaran- Web/Software Developer
Jeyanth Chandru - Python/Java Developer and Data Scientist(R/IBM Bluemix)





NOTE:
An optional feature such as on detection of the eyes, the monitor will be turned on. If the user stands up/moves away the screen will turn off.
